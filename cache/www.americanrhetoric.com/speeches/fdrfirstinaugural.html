      [AUTHENTICITY CERTIFIED: Text version below transcribed directly from 
      audio. (2)]</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">President Hoover, Mr. Chief Justice, my friends: <br>
<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration">
<font color="#0000FF">This is a day of national consecration</font></a>. And I am certain that on this day my 
fellow Americans expect that on my induction into the Presidency, I will address 
them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people 
impels.<br>
<br>
This is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and 
boldly. Nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today. 
This great Nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper.<br>
<br>
So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to 
fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes 
needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our 
national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that 
understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to 
victory. And I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership 
in these critical days.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In such a spirit on my part 
and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only 
material things. Values have shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our 
ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious 
curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of 
trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers 
find no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in thousands of 
families are gone. More important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim 
problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return. Only 
a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet our distress comes from no failure of substance. We 
are stricken by no plague of locusts. Compared with the perils which our 
forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still 
much to be thankful for. Nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have 
multiplied it. Plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in 
the very sight of the supply.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Primarily, this is 
because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their 
own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and 
have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in 
the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">True, they have tried. But their efforts have been cast in 
the pattern of an outworn tradition. Faced by failure of credit, they have 
proposed only the lending of more money. Stripped of the lure of profit by which 
to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to 
exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence. They only know the 
rules of a generation of self-seekers. They have no vision, and when there is no 
vision the people perish.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, the money changers 
have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization. We may now 
restore that temple to the ancient truths. The measure of that restoration lies 
in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary 
profit.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Happiness lies not in the mere possession of 
money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The 
joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase 
of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost 
us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to 
minister to ourselves, to our fellow men.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes 
hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and 
high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place 
and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in 
business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and 
selfish wrongdoing. Small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only 
on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, 
and on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone. 
This Nation is asking for action, and action now.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable 
problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by 
direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat 
the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, 
accomplishing great -- greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our 
great natural resources.</font><hr>

</p>
	<hr><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Hand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the 
overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a 
national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land 
for those best fitted for the land.<br>
<br>
Yes, the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of 
agricultural products, and with this the power to purchase the output of our 
cities. It can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing 
loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms. It can be helped by 
insistence that the Federal, the State, and the local governments act forthwith 
on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced. It can be helped by the 
unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, 
unequal. It can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms 
of transportation and of communications and other utilities that have a 
definitely public character. There are many ways in which it can be helped, but 
it can never be helped by merely talking about it.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
We must act. We must act quickly.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
<img border="1" src="../images/fdrfirstinaugural.jpg" width="232" height="296">&nbsp;
And finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work, we require two safeguards 
against a return of the evils of the old order. There must be a strict 
supervision of all banking and credits and investments. There must be an end to 
speculation with other people's money. And there must be provision for an 
adequate but sound currency.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These, my friends, are 
the lines of attack. I shall presently urge upon 
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/73rd_United_States_Congress#Major_legislation">
	<font color="#0000FF">a new Congress in special 
session</font></a> detailed measures for their fulfillment, and I shall seek the immediate 
assistance of the 48 States.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through this program of 
action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and 
making income balance outgo. Our international trade relations, though vastly 
important, are in point of time, and necessity, secondary to the establishment 
of a sound national economy. I favor, as a practical policy, the putting of 
first things first. I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by 
international economic readjustment; but the emergency at home cannot wait on 
that accomplishment.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The basic thought that guides 
these specific means of national recovery is not nationally -- narrowly nationalistic. It is 
the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the 
various elements in and parts of the United States of America -- a recognition 
of the old and permanently important manifestation of the American spirit of the 
pioneer. It is the way to recovery. It is the immediate way. It is the strongest 
assurance that recovery will endure.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the field of 
world policy, I would dedicate this Nation to the policy of the good neighbor: 
the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects 
the rights of others; the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the 
sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">If I read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, 
as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other; that we can 
not merely take, but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must 
move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common 
discipline, because without such discipline no progress can be made, no 
leadership becomes effective.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are, I know, ready 
and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline, because it 
makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good. This, I propose to 
offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us, bind upon us all as 
a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed 
strife.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With this pledge taken, I assume 
unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a 
disciplined attack upon our common problems.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Action 
in this image, action to this end is feasible under the form of government which 
we have inherited from our ancestors. Our Constitution is so simple, so 
practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in 
emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form. That is why our 
constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political 
mechanism the modern world has ever seen.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">It has met 
every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal 
strife, of world relations. And it is to be hoped that the normal balance of 
executive and legislative authority may be wholly equal, wholly adequate to meet 
the unprecedented task before us. But it may be that an unprecedented demand and 
need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal 
balance of public procedure.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I am prepared under my 
constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the 
midst of a stricken world may require. These measures, or such other measures as 
the Congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, I shall seek, within my 
constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">But, in the event that the Congress shall fail to take one of 
these two courses, in the event that the national emergency is still critical, I 
shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me. I shall ask 
the Congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis -- broad 
Executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that 
would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe.<br>
<br>
For the trust reposed in me, I will return the courage and the devotion that 
befit the time. I can do no less.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We face the 
arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the 
clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean 
satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young 
alike. We aim at the assurance of a rounded, a permanent national life.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">We do not distrust the -- the future of essential democracy. The 
people of the United States have not failed. In their need they have registered 
a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action. They have asked for discipline 
and direction under leadership. They have made me the present instrument of 
their wishes. In the spirit of the gift I take it.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
In this dedication -- In this dedication of a Nation, we humbly ask the blessing of God. </font>
<p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">
<font face="Verdana" size="2">
May He 
protect each and every one of us.</font><p align="left" style="line-height: 150%">

May He guide me in the days to come.</font><hr align="left">
