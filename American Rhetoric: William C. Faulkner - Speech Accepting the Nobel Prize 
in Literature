[AUTHENTICITY 
CERTIFIED: Reading version below transcribed directly from audio version #2]I 
feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work -- a life's 
work in the agony and sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all 
for profit, but to create out of the materials of the human spirit something 
which did not exist before. So this award is only mine in trust. 
It will not be difficult to find a dedication for the money part of it 
commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin. But I would like 
to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from 
which I might be listened to by the young men and women already dedicated to the 
same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who will some day stand 
here where I am standing.Our tragedy today is a general and 
universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it. There 
are no longer problems of the spirit. There is only the question: When will I be 
blown up? Because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten 
the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make 
good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the 
sweat.He must learn them again. He must 
teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching 
himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything 
but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking 
which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity and pride and 
compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes 
not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of 
victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs 
grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but 
of the glands.Until he relearns these things, he 
will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to 
accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply 
because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and 
faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying 
evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny 
inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man 
will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone 
among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit 
capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance.The poet's, the writer's, duty is 
to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting 
his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and 
compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past. The 
poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, 
the pillars to help him endure and prevail.

incomplete. The version published in Les Prix Nobel mirrors Audio version #1 and 
hence contains substantive and stylistic alterations not present in Faulkner's
