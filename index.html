my project, I used several famous speeches from throughout history.
The vast majority of them were by Americans in the 20<sup>th</sup>
century, since those were the speeches that the website that I used
as my sourced had, however I added a couple more text files of famous
speeches that I thought should be included by copy-pasting from
several sources into a text file. I analyzed them for both word and
phrase frequency, because I was curious whether repetition of key
phrases was what made a speech great. </font></font></font>

second part of the program does all the text analysis. The first
function takes in a filename, opens the file from the cache, and
returns all the lines from the file in list format. Then, the next
function takes in that list of lines, and goes through list of lines,
stripping punctuation, making everything lowercase, and adding each
word to a list of words. The next two functions operate on this list
of words. The two key analysis functions are pretty similar. The
first function counts all the words in the document, and adds them to
a dictionary. It then counts the occurrences of each word, and
returns the dictionary with the word frequency. The second function
does the same thing, except it makes dictionaries with the frequency
of  certain 2, 3, and 4 letter phrases. The function contains a loop
which goes through the words list, and finds all possible 2, 3, and 4
letter phrases, and adds them to their corresponding lists. The
function then creates a dictionary for each of the lengths of
phrases. Then, the dictionaries from the word counter and phrase
counter functions are sorted within their respective functions by the
sort dictionary function, which takes in a dictionary, sorts it by
frequency value, and returns a sorted list. </span></span></span></font></font></font></span><span style="font-variant: normal"><font color="#373a3c"><font face="Georgia, Cambria, Times New Roman, Times, serif"><font size="2" style="font-size: 9pt"><span style="letter-spacing: normal"><span style="font-style: normal"><span style="font-weight: normal">Finally,

	results were somewhat interesting, but were not very well organized
	(I could not get the “\n” string to create a new line for some
	reason).  However, it was quite interesting to look at the most
	commonly repeated phrases for speeches I have heard before, such as
	the Gettysburg Address or the I Have a Dream Speech. It turns out
	that what I thought would be some of the most commonly repeated
	phrases in the I Have a Dream Speech were not actually as common as
	I thought they would be. The most commonly repeated 4 -letter
	phrase, with 8 repetitions, was “will be able to,” which makes
	sense in hindsight, but was slightly surprising. Martin Luther King
	Jr. uses a whole lot of repetition in his speeches compared to other
	speeches. For example, the longest and most verbose speech that I
	looked at was Fred	rick Douglass’ “What to a Slave is the Fourth
	of July” speech, which contained 2651 unique words, compared to “I
	Have a Dream”’s 557 unique words. Seeing as Douglass used many
	more unique words, it makes sense that he would not repeat words or
	phrases as much. He had only 10 repetitions of 4-letter phrases
	compared to MLK’s 20. Another interesting thing I found was that
	the mid-length speeches seemed to have the most repetition.
	Obviously there is not much room for repetition in the 2-minute
	Gettysburg Address, but I am not sure why the longer speeches lack
	repetition. </font></font></font>

were a lot of interesting little tidbits like this one, and I enjoyed
poking through the data. If I were to do more work, I would probably
write some function that would help me to get more analysis from my
results. For example, I could compare speeches by the same person to
speeches by different people in word and phrase frequency. I would
also like to try Markov Analysis to make a famous speech of my own. </font></font></font>

set out to explore phrase frequency of famous speeches, and that is
pretty much what I ended up doing. I wish I could have explored
speeches from more diverse sources. I only had two speeches from
non-Americans, and only a couple from before the 20<sup>th</sup>
century. And the vast majority were by white men, which is not ideal,
but is to be expected when using only speeches originally written in
English. Maybe I can figure out how to add to my data set with
speeches in other languages. I would probably need to translate them
to English, especially if they are in a non-latin alphabet, but it
would also be interesting to figure out whether the most commonly
repeated phrases are similar or different in different languages. </font></font></font>

set of questions that sparked my exploration was started when I
learned about speech writing in 8<sup>th</sup> grade, and my teacher
told me that repetition was important. I noticed that there is a lot
of repetition in famous speeches, and that is part of what makes them
so powerful. So now that I had these tools at my disposal, I decided
to use them to figure out how much repetition was really in speeches.
I imagined the results I would get were pretty much what I got, but
in hindsight, it would have been nice to plan some analysis of the
analysis. For example, some way of assigning a value for how much
repetition was in a speech, so I could directly compare them with
each other.  </font></font></font>

think the data source I used for the speeches was pretty good, but I
also supplemented my data set with other speeches that I thought
would be interesting to analyze, like the Gettysburg Address, Nelson
Mandela’s “I am Prepared to Die”, George Washington’s
Farewell Address, Lincoln’s second Inaugural Address (the only
presidential inauguration speech to ever make me cry), Chief Joseph’s
surrender speech, Fredrick Douglass’ “What to the Slave is the
Fourth of July”, and Winston Churchill’s “We Shall Fight on the
Beaches” speech. With these added ones, I was able to get a couple
of non-Americans, and a couple of speeches given before the 20<sup>th</sup>
century in my data. I am very confident that my analysis is 95%
correct. There is one small thing I would change if I had the time,
which is that my program does not take into account the 2 and 3
letter phrases right at the end of the document. I was not quite sure
how else to prevent an out of range error. But anyway, my data is
very accurate, it is just not very filtered. </font></font></font>

am pretty proud of myself for completing this project, especially
since I completed the analysis portion without help from anyone. I
did need a lot of help with extracting the speech from the html. This
is the longest program I have written, and all the functions work
together to produce a result. I think this project was pretty well
scoped. I wish I could have done a bit more, but I have had a very
busy few weeks from FWOP’s performances, and other things going on.
I might work on this project, or at least play with the code some
more, because it produces interesting results that are fun to comb
through. I also did pretty well writing the code piece by piece, and
testing along the way. I included doctests where they were
appropriate, and commented my code well. </span></span></span></font></font></font></span>
